# Tech-Quiz-Test

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to practice creating test code using cypress. I built this project was to create an easy way to confirm if the quiz application is functioning properly. This helps to give a baseline for other developers to create their own test code. I learned about different ways to write code to accomplish the same task if one version is not working as intended.

## Installation

To install the application, download the repository to your local files. Use ```npm run render-build``` to build your application and ```npm run seed``` to seed your application.

## Usage

To use the application, use ```npm run start:dev``` in the command terminal while inside of the develop folder. In a seperate command terminal of the same folder, run ```npm run cypress``` to gain access the the terminals. Alternative commands to run the test are ```npm run test``` and ```npm run test-gui```.
